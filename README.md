# Asian Food Emojis
A spinoff from Angela Yu's emojipedia React challenge. This was an exercise in using React props; I liked it so much I forked it, and put my own twist on it!

## What is it?
- A React-based webpage, describing unicode emojis associated with Asian food.

## What problem does it solve?
- This was a practice exercise for mapping data to React props. It took me a little time (and many start-from-the-beginning retries), but I eventually got it! And I liked the Emojipedia concept so much, I saw an opportunity to put my own creative spin on the project.

## What did I do?
- Nothing crazy! I just forked the [original](https://codesandbox.io/s/mapping-components-practice-6fkfr?fontsize=14) CodeSandbox; created my own array of Asian food emojis (using [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/food-drink/)'s great descriptions), imported it into the app; and applied my own styles.;

## Why did I do it?
- Because I love design! 
- I chose [#ff3500](https://encycolorpedia.com/ff3500) (*shuiro*, "vermillion"), because that's traditionally the color of *Torii*, the ornate gates of Japanese Shinto shrines. ⛩
  - The color red also represents good fortune in Japan and China, another reason why I chose it. 
- I looked at the tints of #ff3500 and saw that #ffe1d5 would be a great complimentary color for the page's background.
